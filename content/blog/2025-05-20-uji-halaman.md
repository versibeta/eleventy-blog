Let me tell you something.

Today is my birthday.

And not only that, but a new stage of my life begins today.

I will no longer live day by day.

Instead, I will focus on living in the present to shape a promising future.

It's time to wake up, to recognize that I can indeed grow, that it's never too late, and that being alive and healthy gives me the opportunity to always move forward.

No more wasting this opportunity.

I know I can because I believe in myself.

The fact that I'm celebrating today is the definitive proof that I am destined for great things.

I won't listen to anything that doesn't fill my heart or my life with goals to achieve.

I won't allow anyone to set me back.

And instead of seeing darkness, I will always seek the light.

Because that's what radiates from my being and where I must always advance.

I will make the most of every second as I have the most beautiful gift, which is being alive.

Happy birthday to me.

Because I love and will always surpass myself.

In a year, I will know that everything was worth it and more.

Happy birthday, buddy.

I love myself.
